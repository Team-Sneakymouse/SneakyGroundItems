# Agent instructions


<!-- BEGIN TEAM-POLICY MANAGED BOOTSTRAP -->
This project is enrolled in Team-Sneakymouse development policy via a sibling checkout (see `.team-policy/pointer.json`).

Resolve the policy root: try each `local_candidates` path in the pointer relative to this project root. If none exist, `git clone` the pointer `remote` into the first candidate using the developer's existing Git credentials. If a checkout exists but is behind `origin/<track_branch>`, `git fetch` and fast-forward that branch when safe; if local edits block the update, report and ask.

Before implementing, review `<policy-root>/README.md` as the current policy index and load the linked guidance relevant to the task. At minimum, when authorization or risk is unclear, read `<policy-root>/policy/core.md`; read `<policy-root>/policy/scope-and-testing.md` when classifying risk or changing behavior; and read `<policy-root>/workflows/development.md` for nontrivial multi-step work. For substantial Paper features, persistent world state, or changes spanning components, read `<policy-root>/policy/paper-plugin-maintainability.md`. Read `<policy-root>/policy/sneakyutils.md` when adding or sharing Paper util/manager code. Load optional skills from `<policy-root>/skills/` only when relevant.

Do not substitute remembered rules, a web mirror, or an unlisted path. Follow local build/architecture facts and explicit exceptions below. When host instructions and team policy repeat the same norm, follow the host wording. If they require incompatible actions, surface the conflict before expanding work. Distinguish running checks from implementing tests; a source edit does not automatically require a new test.

- When changing ground-item behavior or terminology, read [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) and [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).
- When changing persisted ground-item metadata, check SneakyBalls consumers as well as compatibility with saved worlds; SneakyBalls reads the PDC directly.
